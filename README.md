# Canary in a Vault

## Purpose

This project exist to act as a sort of "canary in the coalmine" for Vault. It is a Google App Engine application whose only purpose is to request a key from Vault once a second. By looking at your logs, you can easily confirm that Vault is up and available.

### Vault Local 
You need to have [Vault installed](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install/install.html) on your local machine.

### Pip
You need to `pip install` some app engine depencies into your local `/lib` directory.
```
> git clone git@github.com:samedhi/canary-in-a-vault.git
> cd canary-in-a-vault
> pip install --ignore-installed --target=lib -r requirements.txt
```

### Setup a Secret 
You need to put something to look up in Vault.
```
